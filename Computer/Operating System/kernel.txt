Kernel is the central core of a computer operating system

Process Management (Process, Thread)
Memory Management (segmentation, virtual memory)
Concurrency (Scheduler)
IPC, Filesystem
VFS, System call
Device Drivers

Operating systems are the lowest level software that control the computer’s hardware 

Monolithique = Qui est d'un seul bloc de pierre.

Monolithic Kernel
	- Static
		All of the operating system is in Kernel Space

	- Modular
		All of the operating system is in Kernel Space but drivers can be loaded dynamically into kernel

Micro Kernel
	Kernel is as light as possible, the remaining function are loaded into user space as services.
	Kernel Code = IPC, Virtual Memory, Scheduling

Advantages 
Monolithic : performances
MicroKernel : Modularity, Complexity, Flexibility, Security, Compatbilité
