Others :

ASLR = Address Space Layout Randomization
PIE  = Position Independant Executable
The last abbreviation is PIE, meaning Position Independent Executable.
 A No PIE application tells the loader which virtual address it should use 
(and keeps its memory layout quite static). 
Hence, attacks against this application know up-front how the virtual memory 
for this application is (partially) organized. Combined with in-kernel ASLR
(Address Space Layout Randomization, which Gentoo's hardened-sources of course support) 
PIE applications have a more diverge memory organization, 
making attacks that rely on the memory structure more difficult.
